            my name is liza, and i was born and raised in atlanta, ga. i have two older sisters, and we all three live 
            in nashville, tn now. i went to the university of georgia and LOVE cheering the dawgs on in football and taking
            trips to visit my college friends. my undergrad degree is in english education, but i ended up going into events 
            and logistics after college. i lived in the bay area for a year running the behind the scenes for an event decor 
            company. we did everything from artists' dressing rooms for stadium shows and festivals to building a live plant 
            wall for a super bowl installation.
            <br>
            <br>
            once i moved to nashville, i started working for a teen adventure travel company called 
            <a href=https://www.moondanceadventures.com>moondance adventures</a>. moondance takes middle school and high school kids
            on outdoor adventure trips that go all over the world! kids will backpack, rock climb, scuba dive, surf, and more!
            i was on the operations team during my time there, so i got to plan and arrage all of the logistics for each 
            itinerary. i was also fortunate enough to scout and visit several different trips which took me to places like 
            the dolomites, ecuador, croatia, belize, portugal, and more!
            <br>
            <br>
            i've lived in nashville for six years now and absolutely love it. it's a really fun town that's growing fast. the 
            people are really kind and fun to be around. and there's more to nashville than just country music and honky tonks!
            plus, i have great community here between family (including my little niece!) and friends!

                        growing up, i was outside as much as possible. this could simply be running around the neighborhood 
                        with my friends or exploring the woods of north georgia at my family's cabin. adventure is something 
                        i always seek. i especially love backpacking, camping, swimming, rock climbing, and scuba diving.
