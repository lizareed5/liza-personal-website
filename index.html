            my name is liza, and i was born and raised in atlanta, ga. i have two older sisters, and we all three live 
            in nashville, tn now. i went to the university of georgia and LOVE cheering the dawgs on in football. my 
            undergrad degree is in english education, but i ended up going into events and logistics after college. i 
            lived in the bay area for a year running the behind the scenes for an event decor company. we did everything 
            from artists' dressing rooms for stadium shows and festivals to building a live plant wall for a super bowl 
            installation.
            <br>
            <br>
            once i moved to nashville, i started working for a teen adventure travel company called 
            <a href=www.mooondanceadventures.com>moondance adventures</a>. moondance takes middle school and high school kids
            on outdoor adventure trips that go all over the world! kids will backpack, rock climb, scuba dive, surf, and more!
            i was on the operations team during my time there, so i got to plan and arrage all of the logistics for each 
            itinerary. i was also fortunate enough to scout and visit several different trips which took me to places like 
            the dolomites, ecuador, croatia, belize, portugal, and more!
            <br>
            <br>
            i've lived in nashville for six years now and absolutely love it. it's a really fun town that's growing fast. the 
            people are really kind and fun to be around. and there's more to nashville than just country music and honky tonks!

            over the years, i've tried many different things and found many different interests. the below are my top hobbies.
            <ol id="topHobbies">
                <li>being outside</li>
                    <p id="beingOutside" class="littleParagraph">
                        growing up, i was outside as much as possible. this could simply be running around the neighborhood 
                        with my friends or exploring the woods of north georgia at my family's cabin. adventure is something 
                        i always seek. i especially love backpacking, camping, swimming, rock climbing, and scuba diving.

                        moondance was a major catalyst for my already existant passion for traveling. traveling brings a 
                        certain challenge and possibility for growth that i love. there is so much to see and so many 
                        different people to meet in this world. i thrive during every aspect of travel from the planning to 
                        the pivoting when things go wrong! my top three places i've visited are: </p>

                        my ideal dinner out is at a hip place with close friends and we order a bunch of different things and 
                        eat family style. cocktails too, of course! nashville is constantly getting new restaurants and bars 
                        so it's a great place to explore new foods, drinks, and atmospheres. check out my favorite spots in

                        i am a sucker for film and tv. i'm not sure i would consider myself a "movie buff" but i certainly
                        enjoy a good film and love discussing the different aspect of creating the visual representation of
                        a story. i've visited the telluride film festival the past few years which has been a blast!

                        when i'm not exploring a new restaurant, i love to explore in the kitchen! cooking puts my mind at
                        ease and helps me declutter my mind. don't get me wrong though, i love popping a frozen pizza in the 
                        oven as well!

                        my girlfriend and i have recently gotten into tennis more, and it's been so much fun! we're lucky to
                        live across the street from some courts, so it makes it really convenient and easy to play! it's been
                        fun to hone in on certain skills and improve our communicaiton when we play doubles!
